Apprentices.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Goodchild</span> was admittedly the most successful of merchant
princes&mdash;not only financially, but morally. From a boy the great trader
had advanced on the road of commerce by leaps and bounds. His parents
were of humble birth and in poor circumstances, and yet he had risen to
the top of the tree of commercial prosperity. Mr. <span class="smcap">Goodchild</span>
had shops, warehouses, wharfs, and a fleet of ships. He had never had
a reverse. All he had touched had turned to gold. This is so well
understood that a description of his enormous wealth in detail would be
entirely superfluous.</p>

<p>"Do you really want to know the secret of my pecuniary triumph?" asked
Mr. <span class="smcap">Goodchild</span>, when he was questioned on the subject.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," was the reply. "How is it that your companion, the
idle apprentice, came to such signal grief?"</p>

<p>"Because he was always reading the worst of literature. He knew the
history of every felon recorded in the <i>Newgate Calendar</i>, original
edition, and added chapters. That brought my 'colleague as a boy' to
such dire disaster."</p>

<p>"And you never perused the pernicious documents?"</p>

<p>"Never. And I can prove my statement to the hilt."</p>

<p>"You never perused them! And why not?"</p>

<p>"Because," returned the prosperous capitalist with a gentle smile,
"those in whose hands my future rested had my true interest at heart.
<i>I was never taught to read!</i>"</p>

<p>And with this suggestive announcement (well worthy of the attention
of ratepayers who can control the expenditure of the School Board)
the history of the two apprentices is brought to a conclusion at once
pleasing and instructive.</p>

<p>The Traveller from the Earth left his balloon and trod the cloud that
seemed prepared to receive him. As he did this there was a peal of
laughter which echoed far and wide.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" asked the explorer in English, for he was British-born.</p>

<p>"You have come to the head-quarters of waggery," returned the Resident,
recovering from a violent fit of merriment. "We are never dull here, we
have so much to amuse us."</p>

<p>"Indeed! And how is that?"</p>

<p>"Why, I take a delight in effecting the most comical transformations
imaginable. By the simplest means I can cause an inhabitant of the
Earth to change his costume five times in as many hours. The jest is
provocative of limitless mirth, especially amongst the doctors and the
undertakers."</p>

<p>"And what are the simplest means?"</p>



<p>"Why, I will serve up on Monday a sun worthy of the most fiery day
in an unusually sultry August. On Tuesday I will send a gale and
hailstones, suggestive of the arctic regions at Yule-tide. On Wednesday
I will resume the oppressive heat until streams dry up, and water rises
to a premium. Then on Thursday I will cover the ground with snow, and
finish up the week with a deluge."</p>

<p>The Stranger raised his hat and answered, "The Clerk of the Weather, I
presume?"</p>

<p>"Quite so," was the immediate response. "And now you must leave me to
my work, or Englishmen will have nothing to talk about."</p>

<p>And the balloon once more continued its progress amidst a perfect salad
of the elements.</p>

<p>"Very amusing," thought the Traveller, and then he added aloud,
speaking incidentally the opinion of all his countrymen, "but
distinctly inconvenient!"</p>

<p class="center">BY OUR NOTES-AND-QUERY-MAN.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Mem. for the next Historian of England.</i></p>

<p>It is probable, from recent discoveries in the Archives of the State
Paper Office, that immediately after the time of <span class="smcap">Cranmer</span>,
in consequence of his having recanted two or three times, the See of
Canterbury was to have been re-named "The See of Recanterbury." Also
the question as to the origin of the name is, we believe, finally
settled by the fact having come to light, that, every Archbishop,
in consequence of the extent of his diocese and the necessity of
his taking exercise, was compelled to be (as was Dr. <span class="smcap">Tait</span>,
and as is the present Archbishop, Dr. <span class="smcap">Benson</span>) an excellent
equestrian, and that the favourite pace for proceeding comfortably
and expeditiously was "a canter." The origin of the "bury" has yet
to be accounted for, as it has been spelt at various times "<i>bery</i>,
"<i>berry</i>", "<i>berie</i>," "<i>burrie</i>," "<i>bury</i>." But Kent being an hop
county, and beer the popular beverage from time immemorial, it is
highly probable that as "<i>canter</i>" referred to the horse, so "<i>bery</i>"
(with the "<i>e</i>" long "<i>beery</i>") referred to the refreshment for
man (not for beast) required during the journey. This is from an
antiquarian point of view most interesting.</p>

o' no geese, I ain't&mdash;nor yet <span class="smcap">Lily</span> wasn't neither. We sor a
pig 'aving a ring put froo 'is nose one day. 'E 'ollered out like 'e
was bein' killed&mdash;but 'e wasn't. An' there was a blecksmiff's, where
they put the 'orse's shoes on red 'ot, an' the 'orse 'e never took no
notice. Me an' <span class="smcap">Lily</span> used ter go fur long walks, all under

it, till I tole 'er 'ow&mdash;an' it run up a tree zigzag, and jumped on
to another ever so fur. That was when we was pickin' nuts. We went a

with grite big 'orns.... Suthink like 'im as is drawed outside the

'ome to Muvver&mdash;kissantimums, marigoles, an' dyliers, all sorts there
was&mdash;an' Muvver she put 'em in a jug, an' soon as ever I shet my eyes

Whatsy? 'Ere, <span class="smcap">Florrie</span>, you ain't <i>croyin'</i>, are yer?... Why

Well, I ain't goin' at all&mdash;<i>now</i> I 'ope you're pleased.... What's the
good o' bein' <i>sorry?</i>... Oh, I don't keer much, I don't.... Set down
on this step alonger me, then, and don' you go sayin' nuffink, or I'll
stop tellin' yer.... You remember me goin' in yes'day arternoon to 'ear
what the lidy said? Well, when I got in, I 'eard 'er s'y, "Yus, it'll
be a great disappintment fur <span class="smcap">'im</span>, pore boy," she sez, "arter
lookin' forward to it an' all; but it can't be 'elped." An' Muvver, she
sez, "'Is Farver'll be sorry, too; it done <span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> ser much good
larst time. 'E can't pay not more nor 'arf-a-crownd a week towards it,
but he can manage that, bein' in work jes now." But the lidy sez, "It's
this w'y," she sez, "it costis us neelly arf a suffering over what the
parints pays fur each child, and we ain't got the fun's fur to send
more 'n a few, 'cos the Public don' suscroibe ser much as they might,"
she sez. "An' so this year we're on'y sending children as is delikit,
an' reelly <i>wants</i> a chinge." So yer see, I ain't a goin'. I dunno as
I'm delikit; but I <i>do</i> want the kerntry <i>orful</i> bad, I do. I wish I
never 'adn't bin there at all, 'cos then preps I shouldn' mind. An' yit
I'm gled I bin, too. I dreamt about it larst night, <span class="smcap">Florrie</span>,
I did. I was a-settin' on this 'ere step, sime as I am now, an' it
was 'ot an' stoiflin', like it is; an' all of a suddink I see Mr.
<span class="smcap">Kennister's</span> cart wiv the grey 'orse turn into our court an'
pull up hoppersite, an' <i>Bob Rumble</i> 'e was a-drivin' on it. An 'e sez
"Jump up!" he sez, "and I'll tike yer back to Mr. <span class="smcap">Delves's</span>
cottidge." And I sez, "May <span class="smcap">Florrie</span> come too." An 'he sez,
"Yus, both on yer." So up we gits, an' we was droivin' along the lanes,
an' I was showin' yer the squills an' the stagses, an' jes as we come
to the turn where yer kin see the cottidge&mdash;&mdash;Well, I don' remember no
more on it. But it was a noice dream so fur as I got wiv it, an' if I
'adn't never bin there, I couldn' ha' dreamt it, <i>could</i> I, eh? An',
like as not, I'll dream the rest on it anuvver night.... An' you must
try an' dream your share, too, <span class="smcap">Florrie</span>. It'll be a'most like
bein' in the kerntry in a sort o' w'y fur both on us, won't it?</p>

<p>At a banquet given in Bristol in honour of the invincible bicyclist,
Mr. <span class="smcap">A. A. Zimmerman</span>, a reverend gentleman suggested that
the Town Councillors should present the freedom of that city to the
two champions <span class="smcap">W. G. Grace</span> and <span class="smcap">A. A. Zimmerman</span>.
Another spokesman, on the same festive occasion, remarked that he had
heard of a book called <i>Zimmerman on Solitude</i>. He had never seen
<span class="smcap">Zimmerman</span> on Solitude, but he had beheld him on a safety.
Really in Bristol their badinage is quite brilliant!</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, August 12.</i>&mdash;Back in the old place. Same
address; same walls; same benches; same stage in short, but almost
entirely new company. <span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span> lends friendly
look to Front Opposition Bench. But there are many vacant places to
right and left of him. Where is <span class="smcap">John Morley</span>, and <span class="smcap">Arnold

not save his seat among them? What has become of <span class="smcap">John Hibbert</span>,

beauty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sark</span>, looking round on other quarters of House, cannot refrain
from dropping a salt if silent tear. "You call this the House of
Commons," he said, bitterly, "and find in it no place for <span class="smcap">Alpheus
Cleophas</span>? One black man may be as good as another, and even
better; that is the <span class="smcap">Markiss's</span> affair. As <span class="smcap">Virgil</span> wrote

<span class="smcap">Conybeare</span>, our <span class="smcap">Seymour Keay</span>, and our <span class="smcap">Don't Keir
Hardie</span>? I suppose it's all right. The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> will take
Chair at usual hour; questions will be put and answered; Bills will
make progress and 'the House will now adjourn.' But if the House of
Commons is itself without the eminent persons I have mentioned, I at
least shall not be able to recognise its identity."</p>

<p>"Oh, cheer up," said <span class="smcap">St. John Brodrick</span>, Premier-maker,
Destroyer of Majorities, sort of Parliamentary <span class="smcap">Warwick</span>.
"You don't know what the future may have in store for you. There are
fathomless possibilities in this unfamiliar crowd. It's true no new
Members, as far as I observed, came down in a brake accompanied by
trumpets also and shawms. But <span class="smcap">Don't Keir Hardie</span> didn't live
up to that introduction. The fact is, it probably had something to do
with his distinct failure. It raised expectation too high, and even his
collarless shirt, his short jacket, his Tweed cap, and his tendency
to shed papers out of his over-stuffed pockets as he walked about the
premises, didn't make up what was lacking."</p>

<p>Whilst <span class="smcap">Warwick Brodrick</span> talking, he was constantly turning
over things in his pockets. Thought at first it was money. "Been
drawing your salary a quarter in advance?" I asked, anxious to learn
the habits of the new Ministry.</p>

<p>"No," said <span class="smcap">Warwick</span>, "it's not that. See," he said, picking
out handful of small bullets; "these are what we use in the new rifles
fired with cordite. Nice things you know. Will hop across two miles
before you know where you are. In the other pocket got a few charges of
cordite. No! Rather not see them? Well, no accounting for prejudice. I
mean to keep a supply always on hand, or rather in pocket. Opposition
not likely to do anything much yet awhile. But they'll try and form
up by-and-by. When they do, I'll show 'em a cordite cartridge, rattle
a few of these bullets, with their cupro-nickel jackets, and, poof!
they're off just as they were when I defeated the late Government in
June. Can't have too much of a good thing. What cordite's done once it
may do again."</p>

<p>And the Financial Secretary to the War Office walked off,
ostentatiously rattling the contents of his pockets as he passed
<span class="smcap">Cawmell-Bannerman</span>, who visibly faltered.</p>

<p class="center">THE CHEAP EXCURSIONIST.</p>

<p>Did the good neighbour go by the cheap excursion? Yes, the good
neighbour did go by the cheap excursion, and so did his wife, his
wife's mother, and his six children. Did he catch the cab of the early
driver? No, he did not catch the cab of the early driver, but he used
the omnibus of the sleeping coachman, who took him as far as half-way
(half-way as far as). Had the good neighbour to finish the journey to
the railway station on foot? Yes, he had, and so had his wife, his
wife's mother, and his six children. Are they in a good temper, or
a bad temper? They are in a bad temper, because it is raining, and
because the mother of the wife of the good neighbour had not wished to
go. Have they found the right train? No, they have not found the right
train, but are entering carriages bound for another destination. Has
the guard of the wrong train disturbed the good neighbour, his wife,
his wife's mother, and his six children? The guard of the wrong train
has disturbed them, and has thrust them into the bad carriages of the
right train. Were not the bad carriages of the right train already
crowded? They were already crowded with the hairdresser, the artist's
model, the plasterers, the builders, the sweeps, the fruiterers, and
the quiet young man who contributes poetry to the columns of a local
paper. Did not the entrance of the good neighbour, his wife, his
wife's mother, and his six children, inconvenience the hairdresser,
the artist's model, the plasterers, the builders, the sweeps, the
fruiterers, and the quiet young man who contributes poetry to the
columns of the local paper? It did, and caused most of them to use
bad language (<i>i.e.</i>, oaths). Did the quiet young man who contributes
poetry to the columns of a local paper use bad language? No, the quiet
young man who contributes poetry to the columns of a local paper
did not use bad language, because he was in a fit. How did the good
neighbour enjoy his journey? The good neighbour did not enjoy his
journey, because he had to submit to the smoke of the hairdresser, the
lavender water of the artist's model, the snuff of the plasterers, the
smoke of the builders, the concertinas of the sweeps, the comic songs
of the fruiterers, and the gasps of the quiet young man who contributes
poetry to the columns of a local paper. Did the good neighbour have
to submit to any further inconvenience? Yes, he was abused by his
wife, bullied by his wife's mother, and plagued by his six children.
Was the weather at the destination of the good neighbour favourable?
No, it was not favourable, as it rained heavily all day. Did the good
neighbour find time hang heavily on his hands? Yes, he did find time
hang heavily on his hands; but not so heavily as his wife, his wife's
mother, and six children. Did the good neighbour, his wife, his wife's
mother, and his six children get sufficient to eat? No, they did not
get sufficient to eat; but they discussed the broken scraps left at
a shilling ordinary (<i>i.e.</i>, ordinary price one shilling). Were they
happy to get home? Yes, they were happy to get home; but had to return
with the hairdresser, the artist's model, the plasterers, the builders,
the sweeps, the fruiterers, but not the quiet young man who contributes
poetry to the columns of a local paper. Were the hairdresser, the
artist's model, the plasterers, the sweeps, and the fruiterers more
noisy at night than they had been in the morning? Yes, they were more
noisy, because they had all been drinking the much-adulterated beer of
the prosperous but dishonest publican. Did the good neighbour arrive at
home at last? Yes, the good neighbour did arrive at home at last, but
more dead than alive (<i>i.e.</i>, aliver than more dead). Will the wife of
the good neighbour, her mother, and her six children go on a similar
trip on the next suitable occasion? They will go, but they will not be

<p class="center">IN RE THE I. O. C. R. V. C.</p>

<p>The suggestions I was permitted to make on a recent occasion concerning
the future of "the Devil's Own" having been productive of a perfect
torrent of letters, I hope that I may be allowed to reply, before the
commencement of the fast-approaching Long Vacation, through the columns
of a paper that for more than half a century has been the recognised
organ of the Bench, the Bar, and the other branch of the legal
profession. First let me repudiate, with the scorn it justly merits,
and indignation which has moved me to tears, the contention that in
calling attention to the comparatively falling fortunes of the Inns of
Court I was "making a bid for the chiefship of the battalion." Although
willing (no doubt in common with every other Englishman of right
feeling) to shed my blood to its last drop in defence of my country,
I can see no possible good in accepting "the crown and star" of the
I. O. C. R. V. C. No, I prefer the "stuff" of the ranks to the "silk"
of command. So the forensic wag, who apparently found time during the
pauses of a contested election in a wavering constituency to depict
me as a colonel with <span class="smcap">Portington</span> as my orderly, was at fault
in his conclusions. His rough-and-ready pen-and-ink sketch, although
strongly resembling Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Irving</span> in the character of <i>Don
Quixote</i>, was not without a certain rude kind of merit. When I inspect
it (and probably I shall examine it frequently) I shall be reminded
of the talents of one who, had he not been a "Q.C., M.P.," might have
become the rival of <span class="smcap">Rowlandson</span>, the peer of <span class="smcap">Gilray</span>,
and the modern extinguisher of the less serious of the Old Masters of
the sixteenth century. But to return more immediately to the subject of
my correspondence.</p>

<p>"The Brightest Ornament of the British Bench" writes to me to say that
he considers "The Brook Green Volunteer" was the precursor of the
Inns of Court. I respectfully submit to his Lordship that he is in
error. The Brook Green Volunteer was the solitary representative of
his battalion. I am happy to be able to say that the "Devil's Own,"
although no doubt reduced in numbers, has never on parade presented
so insignificant a "field state." Consequently, the statement that
"the regiment is likely to diminish to its original proportions" is a
prophecy founded upon a misunderstanding and nourished upon a fallacy.</p>

<p>The proposal of "One who bows daily to his Lordship during Term Time"
is excellent. My correspondent suggests that the Junior Bar, not
immediately concerned in the business of the Courts, should drill
silently in open Court. Of late it has been ordained by the Red-book
that commands may be conveyed by gesture. Thus, a Judge trying a case,
by raising or depressing his arms, or clenching his fist, might cause
the not-immediately-employed Bar to "turn" to the right or left, or
even to "lie down." This last command might be deemed satisfied by
the Wig-wearers "coming to the sitting posture smartly." At the close
of the day's proceedings, his Lordship might raise his left arm to
the height of his elbow, upon which the temporarily-unemployed might
take up their dummy briefs, and hold them at "the recover." The hand
of his Lordship brought towards the face, with the thumb pointing in
the direction of the nose, might cause the juniors to "turn" right
and left. "Then, when the senior usher raised both his arms towards
the ceiling, the stuff-gownsmen might march to their front through
the corridors until they dismissed without further gesture of command
in the robing rooms." Altogether capital! "One who bows daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> to his
Lordship during Term Time" should publish his suggestions in pamphlet
form, to be sold at the popular price of a penny.</p>

<p>"A Junior of Fifty Years' Standing" considers that no one should be
admitted to an Inn of Court who was unwilling to join the "Devil's
Own." He declares that he himself has done infinitely more work as a
rifleman than as a counsel. "And yet," he adds, "I found the labour
very light. I do not believe I attended more than one parade in the
course of a year on the average." I may add, that possessing the name
of "A Junior of Fifty Years' Standing," I can vouch for my learned
friend's accuracy, eminence, and ability.</p>

<p>"A Judge who prefers Newmarket to the Law Courts," proposes that the
corridors should be utilised as a drill-ground. "Let the Briefless
Brigade drill therein during Term time, so that they may be ready to
hand if needed." A very valuable suggestion.</p>

<p>"One who takes three years of practice to earn a quarter of chambers'
rent" suggests that "The Devil's Own" should adopt as its regimental
motto, "Retained for the Defence." Considering the numbers of the
battalion, I am afraid the device would have a sarcastic significance.
And now, in all sober seriousness, can nothing be done to put the grand
old corps on its former satisfactory footing? It has an illustrious
past&mdash;most of the best known men at the Bar belonged to it&mdash;is it
impracticable to secure for it an equally illustrious future? Men
who, for half a lifetime, have stood shoulder to shoulder in defence
of their clients' causes can surely adopt the same satisfactory and
honourable position to protect the interests of the ancient battalion.
Let Bench and Bar work with a will, and "The Devil's Own" will be
worthy of its title. And with this prophecy (which sounds well, but
is delivered subject to counsel's revision) I bring my communication,
already too long, to an abrupt conclusion.</p>

the festive "mutton-chop" whisker and the jovial goatee! Henceforth
"Bobby" will be beardless, and as he drinks the mid-day pint of that
frothing beverage whose main ingredient&mdash;more or less&mdash;is malt, the
upper-lip hops-tacle, upon which the foam was wont to find a brief
resting-place, will be conspicuous by its absence&mdash;not lost exactly,
but s(h)aved before.</p>

<p class="ph4">ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</p>

<p>President <span class="smcap">Andrews</span>, of Brown University, has contributed to
the <i>North American Review</i> an article entitled "Are there Too Many of
Us?" Personally, I should answer with an unhesitating yes, especially
after Bank Holidays, or <i>fêtes</i> and galas such as those with which the
provinces teem. And it may be noted, by the way, as a curious fact in
the natural history of amusements, that no genuine <i>fête</i> is ever found
without a gala. Conversely a gala without a <i>fête</i> cannot be imagined.
From the presence in your neighbourhood of one of the two you are at
once entitled to infer the presence of the other.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I return, however, to Professor <span class="smcap">Andrews</span>. He proves by a series
of elaborate and convincing calculations that if the world started with
a population of two, the increase in 3,000 years would have become "two
quintillion human beings; viz., to every square yard 3,333&#8531;  persons.
Or the earth would be covered with men in columns of 833&#8531; each,
standing on each others heads. If they averaged five feet tall, each
column would be 4,166&#8532; feet high."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>All this sounds highly stupendous. As I am no mathematician, I cannot
compete with Professor <span class="smcap">Andrews</span> of Brown University on equal
terms, but to my non-mathematical mind the only inference to be drawn
from the Professor's calculation appears to be that the world is not
much more than thirty years old, or, let us say, 30&#8531;. In another
ten years or so, I suppose we shall have to start work on the columns.
Personally, I am not impatient. I am quite willing to let 832 of my
friends get into position first. I can then climb up and complete
the column. How the fractional third is to be made up I know not,
unless&mdash;happy thought&mdash;there is to be an extra allowance of three
tailors to every column.</p>

<p>The Social Democratic Federation has been meeting in conference
at Birmingham. Comrades <span class="smcap">Quelch</span>, <span class="smcap">Belcher</span>,
<span class="smcap">Shayer</span>, <span class="smcap">Geard</span>, <span class="smcap">Tooth</span>, <span class="smcap">Tempest</span>,
<span class="smcap">Watts</span> and <span class="smcap">Wenlington</span> were all on the spot. Some
discussion took place with reference to <i>Justice</i>, the official organ
of the Federation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belcher</span> (Lincoln), in the course of discussion, thought
they ought to induce the workers to take up shares, and to back
<i>Justice</i> to the fullest extent. They were inclined to sneer at
capitalists, but they could not carry on the Federation work without
taking a leaf out of the capitalist's book. (<i>Hear, hear.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">M'Pherson</span>, as one of the auditors, said the branch
accounts in reference to <i>Justice</i> were a disgrace. A great deal was
heard about the immorality of capitalists, but a little more morality
was wanted in some of the branches in regard to the paying of accounts.</p></div>

<p>This, of course, is most lamentable. Even a Social Democrat, it seems,
cannot alter hard facts or get on without money. And at present
nobody seems in want of the particular kind of justice which Messrs.
<span class="smcap">Quelch</span>, <span class="smcap">Belcher</span> and other comrades are anxious to
purvey.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I like to rescue from the dark unfathomed caves of ocean any gem
of purest ray serene. Here is one extracted from the speech of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Powell Williams, M.P.</span>, at the recent dinner of the Birmingham
Conservative Club.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Powell Williams, M.P.</span>, proposed "The Press," and said
that before he spoke of the Press he would like to correct a statement
which Sir <span class="smcap">Meysey Thompson</span> made. That gentleman thought that
Yorkshire was peculiar, inasmuch as it had got rid of something
objectionable in the shape of fever called Shaw-Lefevre. He put in a
claim for distinction for the county of Cornwall. In Cornwall they
would tell you that they had got rid of the worst kind of beer that
anyone ever tasted, and that they called Conybeare.</p></div>

<p>Later on Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span> said that, although the Gladstonian
Press was more numerous than the Unionist Press, it had not been able
to persuade the nation to swallow eighty Irish members&mdash;which is,
perhaps, fortunate; since, to take only one, I am sure Mr. <span class="smcap">Tim
Healy</span> would prove a very tough morsel to digest.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>And here is a rose that, but for me, might have blushed unseen in the
report of the proceedings of the South Dublin Union:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lenehan</span> moved, in accordance with notice&mdash;"That the
pauper inmate nurses be removed from the male and female Roman
Catholic hospitals, and also from the Protestant male and female
hospitals, and trained nurses engaged to look after the sick poor."
During the course of a lengthened address, delivered in a remarkably
loud voice, he urged that the present system of nursing was bad, that
militiamen were employed for the purpose, and that reliance could not
be placed on the paupers at present engaged in the hospitals. He said
that there were at present 184 inmates employed in nursing, and he
proposed to put a trained nurse in each ward, that would be 43, and
two nurses in each hospital, that would be 8, or 51 in all. These 51
nurses, at £30 a year, or 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, would be a little over £29
(<i>laughter</i>), or a saving of some shillings (<i>laughter</i>).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sykes</span>.&mdash;What in the world is the meaning of that
calculation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lenehan</span> repeated his statement amidst great laughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Reilly</span> said he would second the motion for the sake of
discussion, as Mr. <span class="smcap">Lenehan</span> complained that his resolutions
were never seconded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Byrne</span> was surprised that Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Reilly</span> had
seconded the resolution, for Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Reilly</span> was a sensible
man&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lenehan</span>.&mdash;I deny that (<i>laughter</i>).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Byrne</span> said it was all braggadocio, and a desire to obtain
notoriety, that made Mr. <span class="smcap">Lenehan</span> bring this forward.</p></div>

<p>After this no one will be surprised to hear that Mr. <span class="smcap">Lenehan</span>
withdrew his motion. It must be a terrible thing to be accused of
braggadocio and a desire to obtain notoriety.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>And finally here is an estimate of Mr. <span class="smcap">Balfour</span> from a
correspondent of the Birmingham <i>Daily Gazette:</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">The Unionist Majority.</span>&mdash;<i>To the Editor of the "Daily
Gazette."</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Among the many causes assigned for the
above, no one, so far as I know, has suggested the following one. Is
it too much to hope that the statesmanlike character of Mr. <span class="smcap">A. J.
Balfour</span> has influenced greatly the country at large? His simple
dignity, both in majority and minority, his pluck and energy as Irish
Secretary, are still remembered. The <i>Spectator</i> publishes an article
on "Mr. Balfour's Benignity," and at the reception given to the
Medical Association at the Imperial Institute he and his sister were
received with deafening cheers. Lastly, we shall hear nothing from
himself. Surely all parties recognize and admire such a statesman, and
willingly confide in his future.&mdash;<span class="smcap">An Outsider.</span></p></div>

<p>But why are we to hear nothing from Mr. <span class="smcap">Balfour</span> himself. As
one who likes good speaking on either side of the House, I hope we may
hear a great deal from Mr. <span class="smcap">Balfour</span>.</p>

<p>There have been great doings at Cirencester. At a <i>fête</i> (and gala)
in Earl <span class="smcap">Bathurst's</span> park, the chief attraction was the
announcement of a captive balloon, which was expected to make trips
during the afternoon. Unfortunately, however, the gas-main in the
Tetbury Road, where the balloon was filled, was not so large as was
desirable, and the result was that the balloon was not filled till
after five o'clock. It was then taken to the scene of the <i>fête</i> at
Pope's Seat, where every effort was made to make up for lost time.
The Hon. <span class="smcap">B. Bathurst, M.P.</span>, the newly elected member for
the division, made a short speech from the balloon, being received
with loud cheers. The "right away" ascent was afterwards abandoned.
The evening, which proved fine, closed with an excellent display of
fireworks by Professor <span class="smcap">Wells</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">If a captive balloon should refuse to inflate,<br /></span>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sitting Room Only.</span>"&mdash;The election of Sir <span class="smcap">L. Lyell</span>
